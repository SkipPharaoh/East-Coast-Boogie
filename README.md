## East Coast Boogie Overview
## Project Description
#### User Stories
As a user, I will arrive at the East Coast Boogie home page. On the home page I will see a nav bar with four cities that are clickable, bringing me to each city’s homepage. I will also see a carousel of images representing each city. I will also be able to click on each photo bringing me to that city’s page.
 
Within each city’s homepage I will see a list of categories such as places to eat, landmarks and must visits, and events/activities. I will also see a comment section where users can interact with each other and comment on things they have done within that city. When I click on each category, it will bring me to that show page. Within that page will be a list of recommendations based on that category. 


#### MVP Goals


#### Stretch Goals
1) Have multiple cities
2) Have a link for each item, that's displayed under each category, so that takes you to a page that shows an in-depth  description of the activity.
3) Turn our one main comment section to a city-based for each unique city
